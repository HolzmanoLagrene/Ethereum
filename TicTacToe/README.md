#1-Minute Turn Based Tic-Tac-Toe built on Ethereum

Host a game, place a bet and get another to join your game and add to the pot. The winner gets the pot. If no one wins, the pot is split 50/50. If one player decides to back out half way through the game, the other player gets the pot and can claim their reward: there is roughly a 1 minute time period per turn, if limit is exceeded, the opposing player is entitled to the pot.
